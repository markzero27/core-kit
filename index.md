# Introducing CoreKit: A Modular Clean Architecture Foundation for SwiftUI  
*by Mark Daquis*  

Building scalable and testable iOS apps with SwiftUI can be challenging, especially when it comes to managing dependencies and structuring layers like networking, data sources, repositories, and use cases. That‚Äôs exactly why I created [**CoreKit**](https://github.com/markzero27/core-kit): a lightweight, modular package designed to simplify and supercharge your app architecture.

## What is CoreKit?

**CoreKit** is a modular package tailored for SwiftUI projects following Clean Architecture principles. It helps developers streamline dependency injection and manage network services with minimal boilerplate. Whether you're building a small app or a large-scale solution, CoreKit gives you the flexibility and clarity needed to scale.

## Key Features

- üîß **Lightweight Dependency Injection** with `@Inject`
- üåê **Protocol-Oriented Networking Layer**
- üß± **Support for Clean Architecture Layers** (Data Source, Repository, Use Case)
- üß™ **Test-Friendly by Design**

## Dependency Injection Made Simple

CoreKit comes with a powerful `DependencyInjector` and a Swift-friendly `@Inject` property wrapper. Here‚Äôs how easy it is to register and use your services:

### Register Your Dependencies

```swift
DependencyInjector.register(NetworkService<ProductEndpoint>(), key: "productService")
DependencyInjector.register(ProductDataSource() as any ProductDataSourceProtocol)
```

### Inject Anywhere with `@Inject`

```swift
@Inject(key: "productService") private var productService: NetworkService<ProductEndpoint>
@Inject private var productDataSource: ProductDataSourceProtocol
```

No need to manually resolve anything‚ÄîCoreKit handles it behind the scenes.

## Powerful Network Layer

With CoreKit, defining API endpoints is easy and consistent. Just conform your enums to `NetworkEndpoint`, and you‚Äôre good to go.

```swift
enum ProductEndpoint: NetworkEndpoint {
    case listProducts
    case getProduct(id: String)
    case createProduct(name: String, price: Double)

    var path: String {
        switch self {
        case .listProducts: return "/products"
        case let .getProduct(id): return "/products/\(id)"
        case .createProduct: return "/products"
        }
    }

    var method: HTTPMethod {
        switch self {
        case .listProducts, .getProduct: return .get
        case .createProduct: return .post
        }
    }

    var headers: [String: String]? {
        var headers = ["Content-Type": "application/json"]
        if let token = NetworkSession.shared.accessToken {
            headers["Authorization"] = "Bearer \(token)"
        }
        return headers
    }

    var body: [String: Any]? {
        switch self {
        case let .createProduct(name, price):
            return ["name": name, "price": price]
        default:
            return nil
        }
    }
}
```

Then use it like this:

```swift
let productService = NetworkService<ProductEndpoint>()
let products = try await productService.request(.listProducts)
```

## Clean Architecture, Done Right

CoreKit follows Clean Architecture by encouraging the use of layers:

- **Data Sources** ‚Äì Wrap the networking logic
- **Repositories** ‚Äì Abstract and centralize domain logic
- **Use Cases** ‚Äì Encapsulate business logic

This makes your code highly modular and testable.

## Built-in Support for Unit Testing

Testing is a breeze with CoreKit. Mock your services, register them in tests, and let `@Inject` do the rest.

```swift
class ProductRepositoryInjectTests: XCTestCase {
    override func setUp() {
        let mockDataSource = MockProductDataSource()
        DependencyInjector.register(mockDataSource as ProductDataSourceProtocol)
    }

    func testRepositoryUsesInjectedMock() async throws {
        let repository = ProductRepository()
        let products = try await repository.getProducts()
        XCTAssertEqual(products.first?.name, "Injected Mock")
    }
}
```
